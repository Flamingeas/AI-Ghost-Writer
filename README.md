# AI-Ghost-Writer

A personal writing assistant trained on classics and my own fiction.

## About the Project

Over the past decade, I’ve published more than 10 stories on Wattpad, a platform beloved by storytellers. While most of these works remain unfinished, they each carry a part of my voice, my vision, and my desire to write with emotional depth.

This inspired me to build AI Ghost Writer, a fine-tuned language model trained on open-source french classic literature and my own unfinished work. The goal is simple: help me finish what I started, in my own style.

## Project Goals

Fine-tune a generative language model.

Use a custom dataset of:

- Public domain novels (e.g. from Project Gutenberg)
- Short stories and excerpts from my Wattpad archive
- Generate story continuations, dialogue options, or scene suggestions
- Preserve stylistic tone, character arcs, and narrative consistency

## Tech Stack

1. Python & PyTorch
2. Hugging Face Transformers
3. Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation
4. Dataset pre-processing (tokenization, cleaning, segmentation)

## Dataset Sources

- Project Gutenberg Open-source literary classics
- My personal Wattpad stories (exported as .txt or .json files)

## Roadmap of the project

- [x] Gather and clean dataset
- [] Set up training environment
- [] Fine-tune base model
- [] Evaluate style matching
- [] Build interactive demo (CLI or web-based)

## Why This Matters ?

This is a creative experiment in human-AI collaboration. With the help of this AI assistant, I aim to revive unfinished tales, not just faster, but with authenticity.
